Description
===========

Installs ImageMagick and optionally Rmagick (RubyGem).

It can eather install the package distributed with the operating system or compile it from source.

Requirements
============

## Platform:

Tested on:

* Ubuntu (10.04)
* RHEL (6.1, 5.7)

Usage
=====

To install just ImageMagick,

```ruby
include_recipe 'imagemagick'
```

You can also decide on the install type.

With the following you **install from the package**.
This is also the default behaviour of `include_recipe 'imagemagick'`.

```ruby
include_recipe 'imagemagick::package'
```

Use the following package if you want to **compile from source**:

```ruby
include_recipe 'imagemagick::source'
```

In your own recipe/cookbook. To install the development libraries,

```ruby
include_recipe "imagemagick::devel"
```

To install the RubyGem rmagick,

```ruby
include_recipe "imagemagick::rmagick"
```

Which will install imagemagick, as well as the development libraries for imagemagick (so rmagick can be built).

Attributes
==========

* `node['imagemagick']['version']` sets the version to install.
  When not set, it will fall back to the latest.
  Please note: The latest package is listed at http://www.imagemagick.org/download/ whereas the one you can specify by `version` are at http://www.imagemagick.org/download/legacy/
* `node['imagemagick']['checksum']` to validate downloaded package
